              You are about to have or recently had a hip or knee replacement operation. It is standard practice to give patients a medication after hip or knee surgery that thins the blood and reduces the risk of forming a blood clot.

              We are interested in your preferences regarding the side effects, risks, and benefits of different blood thinners. You will be asked a series of questions regarding your preferences.
              There are no right or wrong answers. The results of this survey will not have any effect on the medication you are assigned. The survey takes about
              20 minutes to complete. You may stop and take a break at any time, but please try to complete the survey if at all possible.
