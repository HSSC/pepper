              Hi my name is PEPPER, thank you for participating in this study. I am here to help you complete this survey. Below are some details about the study and how to complete the survey.

              You are about to have a hip or knee replacement operation. It has become standard practice to give patientsâ€™ blood thinners medications to reduce the risk of blood clots that occur
              after joint replacement surgery. Some blood thinners are best at reducing blood clots, but may increase the risk of bleeding during the joint replacement operation. Other blood
              thinners cause less bleeding but may allow more blood clots to form.

              We are interested in your preferences regarding the side effects, risks, and benefits of different blood thinners. You will be asked a series of questions regarding your preferences.
              There are no right or wrong answers. The results of this survey will not have any effect on the medication you are assigned to in the PEPPER study. The survey takes about
              20 minutes to complete. You may stop and take a break at any time, but please try to complete the survey if at all possible.
